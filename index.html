            <h2>What is Software Quality Assurance?</h2>
            <p>SQA is the overarching and systematic process under which a customer specified product or service is created.</p>
            <p class="fragment">SQA organizes, monitors, improves and audits the product or service during every step of the software development lifecycle focusing on the prevention of problems that software development is prone to create. </p>

            <h2>What is Software Testing?</h2>
            <p>Software testing describes a series or set of planned activities, under controlled conditions, which are intentionally designed and executed to uncover failures of the product or service being developed. </p>
            <p class="fragment">Errors and bugs are brought to light with testing, and any resulting failures are recorded, detailed and forwarded back to the development team for additional review and/or repair. </p>

           <h2>Why does software have bugs?</h2>
           <ol>
               <li class="fragment">Lack of and/or poor communication between the customer and developer</li>
               <li class="fragment">A natural result of human factors, trying to mix human nature with logical programming, compounded by the fact that multiple humans were involved in writing the code</li>
               <li class="fragment">The gluing together of many small fragments (units) of code into one large and unwieldy program</li>
               <li class="fragment">Misinterpretation of the requirements</li>
               <li class="fragment">Compatibility issues between application software, operating systems and target environments</li>

       <section>
           <p>It’s not about finding WHETHER the software has defects - all software does. </p>
           <p>It’s about finding <span style="color:red">how many bugs or defects or oversights exist and where they are</span>.</p>

           <p><span style="color:yellow">A software product is “feasible” when…</span></p>

            <h2>Agile: Sprints</h2>
            <p>Sprints: a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.</p>
            <p>The duration of a sprint is determined by the scrum master, the team's facilitator. Once the team reaches a consensus for how many days a sprint should last, all future sprints should be the same. Traditionally, a sprint can last from one week to 30 days.</p>

            <h2>Waterfall</h2>
            <p>The waterfall model shows a process, where developers are to follow these steps in order:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="fragment">Requirements specification (AKA Verification or Analysis) </li>
                <li class="fragment">Design </li>
                <li class="fragment">Construction (AKA implementation or coding) </li>
                <li class="fragment">Integration </li>
                <li class="fragment">Testing and debugging (AKA validation) </li>
                <li class="fragment">Installation (AKA deployment) </li>
                <li class="fragment">Maintenance </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="fragment">Like architects who build a house, the plan is to build the foundation first and not revisit.</p>

            <h2>Spiral</h2>
            <p>The steps in the spiral model can be generalized as follows:</p>
            <ol style="font-size:30px">
                <li class="fragment">The new system requirements are defined in as much detail as possible. This usually involves interviewing a number of users representing all the external or internal users and other aspects of the existing system. </li>
                <li class="fragment">A preliminary design is created for the new system. </li>
                <li class="fragment">A first prototype of the new system is constructed from the preliminary design. This is usually a scaled-down system, and represents an  approximation of the characteristics of the final product. </li>
                <li class="fragment">A second prototype is evolved by evaluating the first prototype, defining the requirements of the second prototype, planning and designing the second prototype, and constructing and testing the second prototype.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p style="color:yellow">What is the most important process in a life cycle of a product and why?</p>
            <p class="fragment">The most important part of the life cycle is the requirement stage. The majority of bugs can be found in bad requirements and thus will save the company you work for millions of dollars. Bad requirements can cause confusion between teams and can create chaos at the workplace.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p style="color:yellow">Why would you log a defect?</p>
            <p class="fragment">It is the job of a tester to find bugs. If bugs are not logged, then there would be no record of the bug found and it would not get fixed. These errors would remain in the code when the customer received the product.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p style="color:yellow">What are metrics?</p>
            <p class="fragment">A metric is a standard of measurement. Software metrics are the statistics describing the structure or content of a program. A metric should be a real objective measurement of something such as number of bugs per lines of code.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p style="color:yellow">What are requirements?</p>
            <p class="fragment">A requirement is a guideline to what the program or product is supposed to do. Good requirement need to be clear, concise and unambiguous because there may be a large group of people that will read the requirement. A requirement also needs to be verifiable, feasible, necessary and complete.</p>
